        <h4>Why we must stay single?</h4>
        <p>Have you ever known that a relationship doesn't always run smoothly? Maybe you only see it from the intimate side; you don't know what's really going on behind the scenes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By being single, you have a lot of time to develop yourself to be better, rather than being tied to a relationship that will only bring momentary pleasure and happiness, believe me.</p>

        A few tips from me
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you always lower your gaze towards the opposite sex, no matter when or where, with the exception of your mother, sister, or cousin.</li>
          <li>Always remember this mindset: liking and loving are two different things.</li>
          <li>Beauty is a relative word, not something that is certain and absolute.</li>
          <li>Stop following pretty girls' Instagram accounts or something like that because that will be a trigger.</li>
          <li>Thinking about girls and such can trigger a relapse of a nofap streak.</li>
          <li>Stress thinking about your single life will also trigger you to smoke, believe me.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>You can search for any tips and tricks for keep forward while stay single on the internet. You might have to try some new things like martial arts, sports, or going to the gym; maybe you can learn something new that you might like. </p>
